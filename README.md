## About
I built this portfolio using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web development. The styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), Its utility-based approach provides a wide range of pre-defined classes that I can apply directly to React tags, saving time and effort. 
The combination of those enabled me to create a fully responsive and visually appealing web page.
