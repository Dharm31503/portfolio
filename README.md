## About
I built this portfolio using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web development. The styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid UI development. The combination of React, Vite.js, and Tailwind CSS enabled me to create a responsive and visually appealing web page.
