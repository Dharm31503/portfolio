## About
I built this portfolio using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web development. The styling is done with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), Its utility-based approach provides a wide range of pre-defined classes that I can apply directly to React tags, saving time and effort. 
The combination of those enabled me to create a fully responsive and visually appealing web page.



## Instructions

To correctly display the portfolio content in your own code editor, please follow these steps:

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```console
npm install
```

After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:
```console
npm run dev
```

Additionally, make sure to install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```console
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
```
Finally, initialize Tailwind CSS configuration by running the following command:
```console
npx tailwind init -p
```

By following these instructions, you will be able to properly display and interact with the portfolio content in your own code editor.
